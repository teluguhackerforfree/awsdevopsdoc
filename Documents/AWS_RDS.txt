AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)
=======================================

-> Every application will contain 3 Layers:
1) Front End (User interface)
2) Back End (Business Logic)
3) Database

-> End Users will communicate with our application using front-end (user interface)

-> When end-user perform some operation in the front-end then it will send request to the backend. Backend contains the business logic of the application.

-> Backend logic will communicate with our Databse to perform DB activities like:
a) Insert
b) Update
c) Retrieve 
d) Delete
=========================================
Challenges with Database Setup on our own
----------------------------------------------
1) Setup a server to install the Database software
2) Purchase Database software license
3) Install this Database software into our server
4) Setup the Network for our machines
5) Setup power of machines
6) Setup a server room or Data center to keep our machines
7) Setup AC for 24/7
8) Setup Database backups
9) Disaster Recovery
10) Setup Security
etc

-> If we use AWS Cloud, then AWS will take care of all the above activities which are required to setup a Database for our application.

-> In AWS, we have AWS RDS service to create and setup databse required for our application.

-> We just need to pay the money and use Database using AWS RDS service.
DB setup and maintainence will be taken care by AWS Admin Team.

-> Using RDS , we can easily set up, operate and scale up/down a relational database in the cloud.

======================================================
We Create Database, verify the connection and finally we will provide the 'Endpoint' url.

User Name: admin
pwd: Tiger*49
Endpoint: database-1.c7wu2mcysc77.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
===================================================
To test the connection, install a tool:
MySql Workbench
