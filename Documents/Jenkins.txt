Jenkins
=============

Jenkins is a CI/CD Tool.

CI : Continuous Integration
CD : Continuos Delivery

#CI CD is one appraoch to automate project Build & Deployment process

#In single day multipe times code will be committed to Github repository from Development team so multiple times we have to perform build and deployment process.

If we do build and deployment process manually then it is time taking process and error prone.

To overcome above problems, we need to automate Project Build and Deployment process.

To automate project build and deployment process we will use JENKINS.
